Stats to scrape in order to create our predictor model:
Fixtures, Form Table, Goals Scored, Goals Conceded, xG (Expected Goals), *then look at past results*


create a spurs stats table and then an opposition stats table... find out who the oppo for the week is and update the table with those stats.
